I"­<p>Okay! So my procrastinating soul finally set on to create the Github pages website! I am learning it from <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Jonathan McGloneâ€™s blog post</a> 
It is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, which I have been interested in for quite some time and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It is definitely not the easiest of tasks for me without knowing an ounce of html and css, but I hear that you donâ€™t need to be an expert. I know some markdown so that should help me. Fingers crossed!
I realize that I am writing my first blog, on the day <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2020/">JSM 2020</a> begins!</p>
